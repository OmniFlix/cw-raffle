# **Raffle Contract**

# **Overview**

This contract manages the raffle for the LAB Drop involving 10,028 NFT raffle tickets minted on the OmniFlix Hub by the StreamSwap DAO. This contract has been developed by OmniFlix to ensure a fair and random raffle process is offered to creators and communities.

The contract is deployed on the Juno Network and integrates with the Nois protocol to ensure fair and transparent selection of random winners.

# **Functionality**

- **Instantiation**: Sets up the contract with the Nois proxy address and participant count.
- **Execution**:
    - **Request Randomness**: Initiates a randomness request to the Nois protocol, requiring a unique job ID and necessary funds.
    - **Pick Winners (Nois Receive)**: Receives randomness from Nois, selects 100 winners, and handles different outcomes based on the job ID context ("test" or regular).
- **Queries**: Provides smart queries for accessing participant count, list of winners, admin details, etc.

# **Setup and Configuration**

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js and Rust installed.
- Access to a Juno Network node or testnet.

### **Installation**

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]

cd raffle-drop-main

cargo build --release

```

### Optimize

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.13.0
```

### **Deployment**

Deploy and instantiate on the Juno Network:

```bash
junod tx wasm store artifacts/contract.wasm --from <your-wallet> --chain-id <chain-id> --gas auto --fees <fee-amount>

junod tx wasm instantiate <code-id> '{"nois_proxy_address": "<address>", "participant_count": 10028}' --label "lab_drop_raffle" --from <your-wallet> --chain-id <chain-id> --amount <init-amount> --gas auto --fees <fee-amount>
```

### **Interaction**

Execute transactions and query contract state:

```bash
junod tx wasm execute <contract-address> '{"RequestRandomness": {"job_id": "unique_job_id"}}' --from <your-wallet> --chain-id <chain-id> --gas auto --fees <fee-amount>

junod query wasm contract-state smart <contract-address> '{"QueryMsg": "Winners"}'
